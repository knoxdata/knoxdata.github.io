## Meetup

Meetup was a great success. After a long hiatus, we had a great set of talks with James and his startup ReviewBox, and Krishna, a grad student in the physics department at UT.

## ReviewBox

James talked about his startup he started in January [ReviewBox](https://getreviewbox.com/) that compiles reports of product reviews for vendors.
There was an interesting discussion in how he got ReviewBox started and a brief dive into some of the nuts and bolts that power Reviewbox. 
Even as a team of 1, really interesting to hear about he has expanded his delivery to more product vendors.

## Large Hadron Collider
[Krishna Thapa](https://getreviewbox.com/) talked about the big data challenges that he faces in interfacing with work that the University of Tennessee Physics Department has with the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) near Geneva, Switzerland.
For his thesis work, he works in the operation and calibration of the Pixel Luminosity Telescope(PLT) detector for the CMS experiment at the LHC.
Amidst millions of particles in just the smallest fractions of a second, he looks at finding 
correction/uncertainties to the detector's luminosity measurement by analyzing the proton-proton collision event data collected by the PLT. He combines `python` scripts for the large data collection, while implementing `R` in his workflow for statistical anaylsis.
