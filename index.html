Plans are underway to schedule a meetup for October, apologies for the long, long delay. But in the meantime, we invite you to come out to the KnoxDevs Quarterly next Tuesday to hear from Paul Singh, a nationally recognized entrepreneur and investor who will be stopping by on his National Tech Tour and speaking to us about what we can do to make Knoxville a successful tech city.
